Your solution will be judged based on:

Whether it works :)
Code style & quality
Your time spent - I expect 30 minutes for this problem
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct a web page that contains one button. When the user presses the button, the page background should fade between colors at the specified times (represented here as minutes:seconds):

0:00.00 Red
0:02.50 Yellow
0:03.50 Blue
0:05.00 Red
0:07.50 Yellow
0:08.50 Blue
etc... forever
Between each color should be a linear fade, so for example at 0:01.25 it would be orange, 0:02.50 would be yellow, and 0:03.00 would be green, etc. This should continue forever, so for example at 1:10 it would be red.

Rules:

You may not use any external libraries
You may not use CSS transitions or animations
