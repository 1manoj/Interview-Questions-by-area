Welcome to our coding quiz interface! The purpose of this format is for us to understand your strengths as an engineer.

Your solution will be judged based on:

Whether it works :)
Code style & quality
Your time spent - I expect 30 minutes for this problem
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct a web page that contains one button. When the user presses the button, the page background should change color at the specified times (represented here as minutes:seconds):

0:00.00 Red event 5 mins
break for 250  setTimeout(function(){ alert("Hello"); }, 3000);	
0:02.50 Yellow every 5 mins
0:03.50 Blue
0:05.00 Red
0:07.50 Yellow
0:08.50 Blue
etc... forever
This should continue forever, so for example at 1:10 it would be transitioning from blue to red.

Rules:

You may not use any external libraries
You may not use CSS transitions or animations
